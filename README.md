# My-Little-Crawler
The little crawler is still growing.

Now, can-dos:
  1. read robots.txt of a certain website
  2. search the whole internet using search engines( may cause copyright or IP problem; planning to delete or modify relevant codes)
  3. download binary contents to a certain path with the function of rename
  4. look up for a location of certain IP address, default for local internet environment
  5. look for links in a certain page( I will emphasize on this part later)

Just some basic tricks, I need to work hard.
